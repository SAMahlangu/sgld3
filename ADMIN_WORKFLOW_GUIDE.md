## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Admin Dashboard Not Accessible

**Solution**: 
- Ensure user has `role = 'admin'` in database
- Check user authentication status
- Verify admin user was created properly

#### 2. Forms Not Appearing
**Problem**: No forms showing in admin dashboard
**Solution**:
- Check if forms have `status = 'submitted'`
- Verify database connection
- Check RLS policies for admin access

#### 3. Decision Not Saving
**Problem**: Admin decision not being recorded
**Solution**:
- Ensure admin fields were added to database
- Check for database errors in console
- Verify admin user ID is valid

#### 4. PDF Download Not Working
**Problem**: PDF download fails for approved forms
**Solution**:
- Check if form status is "approved"
- Verify PDF generator component is working
- Check browser console for errors

### Database Queries for Debugging

#### Check Admin Users
```sql
SELECT id, email, full_name, role 
FROM users 
WHERE role = 'admin';
```

#### Check Form Status
```sql
SELECT id, organization_name, status, admin_decision, admin_comments
FROM forms 
ORDER BY submitted_at DESC;
```

#### Check Admin Decisions
```sql
SELECT 
    f.id,
    f.organization_name,
    f.status,
    f.admin_decision,
    f.admin_comments,
    f.admin_decision_date,
    u.full_name as admin_name
FROM forms f
LEFT JOIN users u ON f.admin_decision_by = u.id
WHERE f.admin_decision IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY f.admin_decision_date DESC;
```

## Best Practices

### For Admins
1. **Review Promptly**: Check for new submissions regularly
2. **Provide Clear Feedback**: Use comments to explain decisions
3. **Be Consistent**: Apply similar standards across all reviews
4. **Document Decisions**: Comments help track decision rationale

### For Students
1. **Submit Complete Forms**: Ensure all required fields are filled
2. **Check Status**: Monitor form status after submission
3. **Read Comments**: Review admin feedback carefully
4. **Download Approved Forms**: Keep PDF copies for records
