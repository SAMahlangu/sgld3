# Login Redirection Debug Guide

## Problem
After successful login, users are not being redirected to the dashboard.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Missing Navigation Logic ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: The LoginForm component was not handling navigation after successful login.
**Solution**: Added `useNavigate` hook and navigation logic.

### 2. Authentication State Management ✅ ENHANCED
**Issue**: Potential disconnect between localStorage and React state.
**Solution**: Added debugging and improved state management.

## Changes Made

### 1. LoginForm.tsx Updates
- ✅ Added `useNavigate` hook from React Router
- ✅ Added navigation logic after successful login
- ✅ Added role-based redirection (admin → /admin, student → /dashboard)
- ✅ Added check for already authenticated users

### 2. App.tsx Updates
- ✅ Added debugging to ProtectedRoute component
- ✅ Added AuthDebug component for real-time state monitoring

### 3. AuthContext.tsx Updates
- ✅ Enhanced localStorage loading with error handling
- ✅ Added detailed console logging

### 4. New Debug Component
- ✅ Created AuthDebug.tsx for real-time authentication state monitoring

## Testing Steps

### Step 1: Clear Browser Data
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Go to Application/Storage tab
3. Clear localStorage for your domain
4. Refresh the page

### Step 2: Test Login Flow
1. Navigate to `/login`
2. Enter demo credentials:
   - Student: `student@example.com` / `student123`
   - Admin: `admin@example.com` / `admin123`
3. Click "Sign In"
4. Watch the browser console for debug messages

### Step 3: Monitor Debug Information
1. Look at the AuthDebug component in the top-right corner
2. Check browser console for detailed logs
3. Verify the user state is being set correctly

## Expected Console Output

### Successful Login
```
=== LOGIN DEBUG START ===
Starting login for: student@example.com
Hashed password: -1032466921
Database connection successful
Query executed successfully
Users found: 1
User found successfully: {id: "123", email: "student@example.com", full_name: "Demo Student", role: "student"}
Setting user session: {id: "123", email: "student@example.com", full_name: "Demo Student", role: "student"}
User context being set...
User context set successfully
Login successful, session created
=== LOGIN DEBUG END (SUCCESS) ===
Login successful, redirecting to dashboard...
```

### ProtectedRoute Debug
```
ProtectedRoute - user: {id: "123", email: "student@example.com", full_name: "Demo Student", role: "student"} loading: false
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Still on Login Page After Success
**Check**:
1. Browser console for error messages
2. AuthDebug component state
3. Network tab for failed requests

**Solutions**:
- Verify database users have correct password hashes
- Check environment variables
- Clear browser cache and localStorage

### Issue 2: Infinite Loading
**Check**:
1. AuthDebug component shows "Loading: Yes"
2. Console for stuck requests

**Solutions**:
- Check Supabase connection
- Verify RLS policies
- Check network connectivity

### Issue 3: Wrong Redirect
**Check**:
1. User role in database
2. AuthDebug component shows correct role
3. Console logs show correct navigation path

**Solutions**:
- Update user role in database
- Clear localStorage and re-login

## Database Verification

Run this SQL to verify demo users:

```sql
SELECT 
    email, 
    full_name, 
    role, 
    CASE 
        WHEN password_hash = '-1032466921' THEN 'student123'
        WHEN password_hash = '-969161597' THEN 'admin123'
        ELSE 'unknown'
    END as password,
    created_at
FROM users 
WHERE email IN ('student@example.com', 'admin@example.com')
ORDER BY email;
```

## Environment Variables

Ensure your `.env` file has:
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

## Files Modified

1. **`src/components/LoginForm.tsx`**: Added navigation logic
2. **`src/App.tsx`**: Added debugging and AuthDebug component
3. **`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`**: Enhanced error handling
4. **`src/components/AuthDebug.tsx`**: New debug component

## Next Steps

1. **Test the login flow** with both demo accounts
2. **Monitor the AuthDebug component** for real-time state
3. **Check browser console** for detailed logs
4. **Verify redirection** works for both roles

## Support

If issues persist:
1. Check the AuthDebug component state
2. Review browser console logs
3. Verify database user data
4. Test with cleared browser data
