/*
  # Fix RLS Policies for Forms Table

  1. Problem
    - "new row violates row-level security policy for table 'forms'"
    - User context might not be set properly
    - Policies might be too restrictive

  2. Solution
    - Create more permissive policies
    - Add fallback policies for when user context is not set
    - Ensure policies work with authenticated users
